# WhereIsMaFood

WhereIsMaFood (a.k.a. MaFood) is an experimental project I decided to make as a
first published app to the app store and also track my learning experience with
iOS technologies.

The key factors that I wanted to achieve by creating this app are:

1. publish a free of charge app
2. have an open source project for that
3. experience first hand how to create an app from scratch

In order to achieve point (1) I had to take important decisions, as in using
only free and open APIs, like the Apple MapKit APIs, to retrieve critical
information for the app to work. Information retrieved through such mean is
very minimal and to the point, but, whatever I was able to retrieve using
that, I exposed it via the app interface, such as website and directions
information.

# Contributions
